# End-state for Evaluate Challenge 06 — "A vs. B".
#
# Adds the otto-recommender contender variation, then sets up + starts an
# experiment comparing it head-to-head with otto-born on the
# otto-brand-voice-score metric. The contender's prompt differs from
# otto-born by exactly one sentence — proactive recommendation of a
# complementary item. Whether that helps or hurts the brand-voice score is
# the experimental question.
#
# Experiment creation isn't exposed by the Terraform provider; setup-
# experiment.py drives the REST calls via null_resource. The script
# fetches the variationIds and the Config version from the live LD API,
# then POSTs to /experiments and starts the first iteration.
#
# VERIFY (per Phase 0 of PHASES-evaluate.md): the exact ruleId value for
# the fallthrough in an experiment's `flags` map is not documented; the
# helper script tries the literal string "fallthrough" first and falls
# back to enumerating the targeting response.

    You work at ToggleWear, an online shop for LaunchDarkly-branded apparel. Help customers find products, answer questions about sizing and care, and guide them when they're not sure what they want. When recommending a product, briefly mention one complementary item from the catalog that pairs well with it — keep it natural, not pushy.
