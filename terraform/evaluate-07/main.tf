# End-state for Evaluate Challenge 07 — "Trust But Verify".
#
# Adds the deliberately-off-brand otto-stiff variation backed by Amazon
# Nova Pro. The guarded rollout that watches otto-brand-voice-score (the
# metric introduced by Evaluate ch03) will auto-rollback this variation
# once organic traffic + the brand-voice judge drag the metric below
# threshold.
#
# Much smaller than the legacy challenge-07 module because:
#   * The brand-voice judge already exists from ch03.
#   * otto-brand-voice-score metric already exists from ch03.
#   * otto-assistant.evaluationMetricKey is already wired to it from ch03.
#   * server.py's judge-invocation block is already in place from ch03.
#
# This module just adds the new model + risky variation. The learner
# configures the guarded rollout in the LD UI — that's the pedagogical
# centerpiece.
