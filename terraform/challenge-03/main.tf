# End-state for Challenge 03 — "Otto on-brand at scale".
#
# Creates two prompt snippets (brand-voice, safety-rules) via REST and updates
# otto-born to reference them. Prompt snippets aren't yet exposed by the
# Terraform provider, so this is all null_resource + curl.
#
# VERIFY: the exact snippet-reference syntax inside a variation message is not
# clearly documented as of authoring. The placeholder used below is
# `{{ldsnippet.<key>}}` — operator will validate the real syntax during the
# click-through and adjust both `local.refactored_prompt` and the
# assignment.md walkthrough.
