title: Otto Knows When to Fold
teaser: Wire an in-app loop that flips Otto's targeting to a safe variation
  when judge scores tank — request-time protection, no rollout required.
notes:
- type: text
  contents: Guarded rollouts protect Otto at release time — they catch a
    regression before it reaches 100% of traffic. But what if a regression
    sneaks through, or a model degrades gradually, or you want a faster
    response than a rollout's monitoring window? This challenge adds a
    request-time safety net — a small loop in the app that watches the
    brand-voice score and flips the fallthrough to a safe variation when
    things go sideways.

# Three safety nets, three timescales

You've now seen two ways to protect Otto:

| Timescale | Mechanism | Demonstrated in |
|---|---|---|
| **Release time** | Guarded rollout watches a metric while ramping traffic; rolls back on regression. | Challenge 07 |
| **Request time** | An in-app loop watches scores and adapts the active variation between requests. | This challenge |
| **Per-request** | Synchronous fallback: if THIS response fails a check, regenerate before it reaches the user. | Track 3 / Coordinate (self-healing) |

Each is appropriate at a different speed of failure. Guarded rollouts catch a known-bad change going into production. Adaptive switching catches a slowly-degrading production state. Self-healing catches a single bad response in flight.

Today you'll wire the middle one.

# Setup deliberately put Otto in a bad state

Open the [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) tab. Go to **Configs → Otto Assistant → Targeting**.

The default rule is currently serving **Otto v4 (Stiff)** to all users. The realchat traffic generator is sending real customer questions through; Stiff's corporate prompt makes the brand-voice judge unhappy on most of them; otto-brand-voice-score is dropping.

Your job: add an in-app loop that watches the score, and when the rolling mean drops below 0.5, flips the fallthrough back to **otto-born** automatically.

# Create the adaptive module

Open the [Code Editor](#tab-2). Create a new file at `app/adaptive.py` with the following content:

```python
"""Adaptive switching for Otto.

Watches a rolling window of brand-voice scores. When the window's mean
drops below a threshold and we haven't recently flipped, calls the LD
REST API to set otto-assistant's fallthrough to a known-safe variation.

Save the file.

A few things to notice:

- **Rolling window** of 20 scores (`deque(maxlen=20)`). Old scores fall off as new ones arrive.
- **Minimum samples** of 10 before the loop even considers flipping — protects against early-life noise.
- **Threshold** of 0.5 (mean below this triggers a flip).
- **Cooldown** of 60 seconds between flips, so a single bad window doesn't trigger repeatedly.
- The actual REST PATCH runs on a **daemon thread** so the /chat handler returns immediately.

# Wire it into server.py

Open `app/server.py`.

1. Near the top of the file, after the existing `import boto3` line, add:
```python
from adaptive import observe as adaptive_observe
```

2. Inside the brand-voice judge block (the one you pasted in Challenge 03), find the line:
```python
                ld_client.track("otto-brand-voice-score", bv_ctx, None, score)
```
   Add a new line **immediately after it**:
```python
                adaptive_observe(score)
```

Save the file. The togglewear service auto-reloads.

# Watch it work

The realchat traffic generator is sending real customer questions through `/chat`. Each one triggers a brand-voice judge invocation, which emits a score, which feeds your `adaptive_observe` call.

1. Open the [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) tab. Stay on **Otto Assistant → Targeting**.
2. Refresh every 15-30 seconds. Within about a minute (10 samples × ~5 seconds per request), the rolling window should drop below 0.5 and your loop should flip the **Default rule** to **Otto v1 (Born)**.
3. The flip happens silently — no notifications. Otto just starts being on-brand again.

If you want to see the loop's reasoning, tail the app log:

```bash
journalctl -u togglewear -f
```

You should see a line like:

```text
adaptive: mean=0.34 below 0.50; flipping in background
adaptive: flipped fallthrough to otto-born
```

# What you built

A tiny request-time controller that closes the loop between an observation signal (judge score) and a control surface (the LD targeting REST API). It runs in your app, not LaunchDarkly's backend — which means you can make it as fast, slow, smart, or paranoid as you want, and you don't need any feature LaunchDarkly hasn't shipped.

The pattern transfers. Anywhere you have an observation metric and a control surface (a flag, a Config, a targeting rule, a feature gate), the same loop applies. The hard part is picking the right threshold and cooldown so you protect customers without thrashing — that part's on you.

Click **Check** when the fallthrough has flipped back to otto-born.
