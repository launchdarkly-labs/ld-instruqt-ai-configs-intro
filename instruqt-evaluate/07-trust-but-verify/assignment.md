teaser: Roll out a risky new model behind a guarded rollout backed by the
  brand-voice judge — watch it auto-revert when quality drops.

  contents: A new model came in from the vendor — Amazon Nova Pro. Marketing
    wants to try it. You want to try it too, but only if it doesn't make
    Otto sound off-brand. This is exactly what guarded rollouts are for —
    ship the change behind a metric, let it watch for regression, and
    automatically roll back if quality drops. The brand-voice judge you
    built in Challenge 03 is the metric.

# What's already in place

Most of this challenge is already wired:

- A new variation, **Otto v4 (Stiff)**, has been added to Otto Assistant. It's backed by Amazon Nova Pro and has a deliberately corporate-sounding prompt — formal greetings, formal sign-offs, the works.
- Background traffic is flowing at ~1 session every 2 seconds. Each session emits an `otto-brand-voice-score` event biased by which model served it. Stiff's mean is well below the others.
- The brand-voice judge from Challenge 03 is already invoking on every real `/chat` call and contributing real scores too.

Your job is to **configure a guarded rollout** that splits traffic between Otto v1 (Born) and Otto v4 (Stiff), watches the `otto-brand-voice-score` metric, and rolls back automatically if Stiff's score regresses.

# Inspect what changed

1. Open the [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) tab.
2. Go to **Configs → Otto Assistant**.
3. Notice the new variation **Otto v4 (Stiff)** in the list. Click it to see the prompt — explicitly formal, the opposite of the brand voice.
4. Click the **Monitoring** tab and select **otto-brand-voice-score**. You should see scores accumulating — most of them in the high range (since most traffic still goes to Born), with no contribution from Stiff yet because Stiff isn't being served to anyone.

# Start the guarded rollout

1. Click the **Targeting** tab. Confirm the environment is **test**.
2. Click the **Default rule** (the fallthrough). You should see an option to **Start guarded rollout**.
<!-- VERIFY: confirm the button is on the default-rule menu and is called "Start guarded rollout" (some LD surfaces call this "Start release"). -->
3. Configure:
   - **Test variation**: **Otto v4 (Stiff)**
   - **Control variation**: **Otto v1 (Born)**
   - **Metric to watch**: **otto-brand-voice-score**
   - **Regression direction**: lower is worse (the metric's success criteria is HigherThanBaseline)
   - **Stages**: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100% (or whatever the UI offers). Each stage's monitoring window should be 1-2 minutes — short enough that the rollout completes inside the lab budget.
<!-- VERIFY: confirm exact UI labels for stages and monitoring window. -->
4. **On regression**: choose **Rollback** (not just notify).
5. Click **Start**.

# Watch what happens

The rollout starts at the first stage (10% Stiff). Background traffic flows through and the brand-voice score for the Stiff variation lands much lower than for Born. Within ~1-2 minutes, the rollout's regression detection should fire.

When it does:

- The rollout shows a **regression detected** event on the **Targeting** tab's rollout timeline.
<!-- VERIFY: confirm the event surfaces here and not in a separate Events panel. -->
- Traffic snaps back to 100% Otto v1 (Born). The Stiff variation gets dropped.
- The monitoring view's brand-voice-score graph shows the dip during the rollout phase, then recovery after rollback.

# If you want to force it

Background traffic is intentionally low-rate so the lab fits in the time budget but doesn't burn through tokens. If the rollback doesn't fire fast enough for demo pacing, run the sabotage script from a terminal:

```bash
/opt/ld/ai-configs-intro/app/.venv/bin/python3 /opt/ld/ai-configs-intro/traffic-generator/sabotage.py
```

It emits 60 low-score events directly. The rollback usually fires within a minute of the sabotage finishing.

# What you just saw

A risky model entered production behind a metric guard. The judge you wrote in Challenge 03 — the one whose criteria came from a snippet you wrote in Build — caught the regression and rolled it back without you watching. That's the whole point: when the safety net runs itself, you can ship more aggressively.

Click **Check** when the guarded rollout is configured and running.
