# Welcome

Over the next ~2 hours, you're going to build an AI shopping assistant for **ToggleWear**, a fictional online retailer of LaunchDarkly-branded apparel. The assistant's name is **Otto**. Right now Otto doesn't exist — by the end of this track, he'll be live in the [ToggleWear](#tab-1) storefront, targeted by user tier, and monitored in production.

You're going to do this using **LaunchDarkly AgentControl**: prompts, models, and rollout strategy as runtime configuration instead of hardcoded values.

# What you'll do

| # | Beat |
|---|---|
| 01 | Create Otto's first Config and wire him into the app. |
| 02 | Change Otto's personality without redeploying. |
| 03 | Factor reusable brand voice into snippets. |
| 04 | Quick quiz to consolidate. |
| 05 | Add a premium-tier Otto, target it by user attribute. |
| 06 | Look at Otto's production data in the monitoring view. |
| 07 | Wrap up. |

This is Track 1 of three. After Build, **Evaluate** picks up where this leaves off — judges, experiments, guarded rollouts, adaptive switching. **Coordinate** is the third, multi-agent track.

# Assumptions

This track assumes you already know the LaunchDarkly basics — flags, contexts, environments, targeting rules. If you don't, the [LaunchDarkly Basics](https://launchdarkly.com) track is a better starting point.

The tabs on the right will all be useful: [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) for the LD UI, [ToggleWear](#tab-1) for the live storefront, [Code Editor](#tab-2) for `server.py` and other repo files.
