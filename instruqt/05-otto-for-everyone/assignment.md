# Two audiences, two Ottos

Free shoppers and premium ToggleWear members get different treatment everywhere else on the site. Otto should be no exception. Premium customers get more time, more detail, and a more capable model behind the answers.

We're going to:

1. Add a second variation backed by **Claude Sonnet 4.5** with a richer premium-tier prompt.
2. Add a **targeting rule** that routes premium customers to that variation. Free shoppers keep getting the Haiku-backed Otto from the earlier challenges.
3. Test by flipping the user-tier dropdown on ToggleWear.

# Add the premium variation

Open the [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) tab. Go to **AI** → **Configs** → **Otto Assistant**.

1. Click **Add variation**.
2. For **Name**, enter:
```text
Otto v2 (Premium)
```
3. For **Key**, confirm or enter:
```text
otto-premium
```
4. Under **Model**, choose the **Bedrock** provider → **anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0** (a more capable model than Born's Haiku). Pick it under **Bedrock**, not the "Anthropic" provider.
5. In prompt text area, make sure **System** is selected, then click **Load snippet** and select **Brand voice**.
6. Below that, enter the following text:

```text
You work at ToggleWear and you're talking to a premium customer. Take a little more time with them. Offer thoughtful recommendations, mention complementary items when relevant, and share interesting product details (materials, care, the story behind a design). You can be a bit warmer and more conversational.
```
7. Click **Load snippet** and select **Safety rules**.
8. Click **Review and save**, then **Save changes**.

Note what we just did: the premium prompt **reuses** the `brand-voice` and `safety-rules` snippets from Challenge 03. If marketing tweaks the brand voice tomorrow, both variations pick it up automatically.

# Route premium shoppers to the premium Otto

Click the **Targeting** tab. Make sure the environment selector reads **test**.

1. Above the **Default rule**, click ** + ** and select **Build a custom rule**.
2. Build the clause:
	1. Context kinds: **user**
	2. Attribute: **tier**
	3. Operator: **is one of**
	4. Values: **premium** _&lt;ENTER&gt;_
3. For the variation dropdown, select **Otto v2 (Premium)**.
4. Leave the **Default rule** as **Otto v1 (Born)** — free shoppers and anyone without a tier still get the Haiku Otto.
6. Click **Review and save**, then **Save changes**.

# See it work

Open the [ToggleWear](#tab-1) tab. The header has a **Logged in as** dropdown. It defaults to **Free user**.

1. With **Free user** selected, click **Chat with Otto** and ask a question:
```text
What's good for cold weather?
```
Otto should be brief and friendly — that's the Haiku-backed Born variation.

2. Close the chat. Change the dropdown to **Premium user**.

3. Re-open the chat (or refresh the page) and ask the same question. Otto should answer at more length, mention complementary items, and feel a bit warmer — that's the Sonnet-backed Premium variation, served because the LaunchDarkly context now has `tier: "premium"` and the rule you just added matches it.

The app's code didn't change. The variation you served changed because LaunchDarkly evaluated the targeting rule against the context.

Click **Check** when you're satisfied.
